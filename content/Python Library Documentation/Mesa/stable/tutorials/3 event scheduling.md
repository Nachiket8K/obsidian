# Event Scheduling & Time

**Important:**

- If you are just exploring Mesa and want the fastest way to execute the code we recommend executing this tutorial online in a Colab notebook. [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mesa/mesa/blob/main/docs/tutorials/3_event_scheduling.ipynb) or if you do not have a Google account you can use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mesa/mesa/main?labpath=docs%2Ftutorials%2F3_event_scheduling.ipynb) (This can take 30 seconds to 5 minutes to load)
- If you are running locally, please ensure you have the latest Mesa version installed.

## Tutorial Description

In the previous tutorials, you created agents, queried them with AgentSet, and learned
activation patterns. In this tutorial, we cover **time** — how Mesa models progress
through time, how you run simulations, and how to schedule events that happen at specific
moments.
By the end of this tutorial you will know how to:

- Understand the two time-tracking attributes: `model.steps` and `model.time`
- Run models with `run_for()` and `run_until()`
- Schedule one-off events at absolute or relative times
- Schedule recurring events with `Schedule`
- Control event priority
- Cancel events and stop recurring generators
- Combine step-based agent activation with discrete events in a single model

## How Time Works in Mesa

Every Mesa model tracks two time-related attributes:

- **`model.steps`** — An integer counting how many steps have been executed (starts at 0).
- **`model.time`** — A float representing the current simulation time (starts at 0.0).

### The default step mechanism

When you define a `step()` method on your model and advance time, Mesa wraps your step
in an internal event system. Each step:

1. Advances `model.time` by 1.0
2. Increments `model.steps` by 1
3. Executes your `step()` method
   You never call `model.step()` directly to run a simulation. Instead, use:

- **`model.run_for(n)`** — Advance time by `n` units (executing `n` steps for standard models)
- **`model.run_until(t)`** — Advance time until `model.time` reaches `t`
  These methods are the primary way to run any Mesa model.

### A quick example

```
class SimpleModel(mesa.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def step(self):
        print(f"  Step {self.steps} at time {self.time:.1f}")

model = SimpleModel()
print("Initial state:")
print(f"  steps={model.steps}, time={model.time}")
print("\nRunning for 3 time units:")
model.run_for(3)
print(f"\nFinal state: steps={model.steps}, time={model.time}")
```

```
Initial state:
  steps=0, time=0.0

Running for 3 time units:
  Step 1 at time 1.0
  Step 2 at time 2.0
  Step 3 at time 3.0

Final state: steps=3, time=3.0
```

Notice that after `run_for(3)`, both `steps` and `time` are at 3. For standard
step-based models, they advance in lockstep. But as we’ll see, events can fire
at *any* time — including between steps.

## `run_for` vs `run_until`

Both methods advance time and process any scheduled events (including the default step events)
along the way. The difference is simple:

- `run_for(duration)` advances time by the specified **duration** from the current time
- `run_until(end_time)` advances time to the specified **absolute time**

```
model = SimpleModel()

print("run_for(2):")
model.run_for(2)
print(f"  → time is now {model.time}\n")

print("run_until(5):")
model.run_until(5)
print(f"  → time is now {model.time}\n")

print("run_for(3) more:")
model.run_for(3)
print(f"  → time is now {model.time}")
```

```
run_for(2):
  Step 1 at time 1.0
  Step 2 at time 2.0
  → time is now 2.0

run_until(5):
  Step 3 at time 3.0
  Step 4 at time 4.0
  Step 5 at time 5.0
  → time is now 5

run_for(3) more:
  Step 6 at time 6.0
  Step 7 at time 7.0
  Step 8 at time 8.0
  → time is now 8
```

`run_until` is particularly useful when you have a fixed end time for your simulation,
or when coordinating with external time references:

```
model.run_until(365)  # Run for one simulated year
```

## Scheduling One-Off Events

Beyond the regular step cycle, Mesa lets you schedule **events** — functions that
execute at specific times. This is useful for modeling things that don’t happen every
step: policy changes, natural disasters, market shocks, seasonal effects, or any
occurrence that happens at a specific point in time.
Use `model.schedule_event()` to schedule a one-off event:

- **`at=`** — Schedule at an **absolute** time
- **`after=`** — Schedule at a **relative** time from now (i.e., `model.time + after`)
  You must specify exactly one of `at` or `after`.

```
class EconomyModel(mesa.Model):
    """A simple economy where a tax reform happens at a specific time."""

    def __init__(self, n=50):
        super().__init__()
        self.tax_rate = 0.1
        self.events_log = []

        # Create agents with wealth
        for _ in range(n):
            a = mesa.Agent(self)
            a.wealth = 10

        # Schedule a tax reform at time 5.0
        self.schedule_event(self.tax_reform, at=5.0)

        # Schedule a stimulus check 2 time units from now (so at time 2.0)
        self.schedule_event(self.stimulus, after=2.0)

    def tax_reform(self):
        self.tax_rate = 0.25
        self.events_log.append(
            f"t={self.time:.1f}: Tax reform! Rate now {self.tax_rate}"
        )

    def stimulus(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.wealth += 5
        self.events_log.append(f"t={self.time:.1f}: Stimulus! Everyone gets 5 units")

    def step(self):
        # Simple taxation each step
        for agent in self.agents:
            tax = int(agent.wealth * self.tax_rate)
            agent.wealth -= tax

model = EconomyModel(10)
model.run_for(7)

print("Events that occurred:")
for event in model.events_log:
    print(f"  {event}")

print(f"\nFinal tax rate: {model.tax_rate}")
avg_wealth = model.agents.agg("wealth", np.mean)
print(f"Average wealth: {avg_wealth:.1f}")
```

```
Events that occurred:
  t=2.0: Stimulus! Everyone gets 5 units
  t=5.0: Tax reform! Rate now 0.25

Final tax rate: 0.25
Average wealth: 7.0
```

**Key point:** Events fire *during* time advancement. When `run_for(7)` processes time,
it encounters the stimulus event at t=2.0 and the tax reform at t=5.0, executing them
at the correct moments. Your `step()` method also fires at t=1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc. as
scheduled events under the hood.

### Canceling events

`schedule_event` returns an `Event` object. You can cancel it before it fires:

```
class CancelDemo(mesa.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Schedule two events
        self.event_a = self.schedule_event(self.event_a_fn, at=3.0)
        self.event_b = self.schedule_event(self.event_b_fn, at=5.0)

        # Cancel event B before it fires
        self.event_b.cancel()

    def event_a_fn(self):
        print(f"  Event A fired at t={self.time:.1f}")

    def event_b_fn(self):
        print(f"  Event B fired at t={self.time:.1f}")

    def step(self):
        pass

model = CancelDemo()
print("Running — Event B was canceled:")
model.run_for(6)
print("  (Event B never fired)")
```

```
Running — Event B was canceled:
  Event A fired at t=3.0
  (Event B never fired)
```

Cancellation is useful when model conditions change. For example, you might schedule
a disaster event but cancel it if agents take preventive action.

## Scheduling Recurring Events

Many models have things that happen repeatedly but not every step — quarterly reports,
seasonal cycles, periodic inspections, or interest payments. Use `model.schedule_recurring()`
with a `Schedule` to define these patterns.
The `Schedule` dataclass specifies:

- **`interval`** — Time between executions (required)
- **`start`** — When to begin (default: current time + interval)
- **`end`** — When to stop (default: never)
- **`count`** — Maximum number of executions (default: unlimited)

```
class SeasonalModel(mesa.Model):
    """A model with regular seasonal events."""

    def __init__(self, n=20):
        super().__init__()
        self.season = "spring"
        self.season_log = []

        for _ in range(n):
            a = mesa.Agent(self)
            a.wealth = 10

        # Change season every 3 time units, starting at t=3.0
        self.schedule_recurring(
            self.change_season,
            Schedule(interval=3.0),
        )

        # Collect taxes every 5 time units, but only 4 times
        self.schedule_recurring(
            self.collect_taxes,
            Schedule(interval=5.0, count=4),
        )

    def change_season(self):
        seasons = ["spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter"]
        idx = seasons.index(self.season)
        self.season = seasons[(idx + 1) % 4]
        self.season_log.append(f"t={self.time:.1f}: Season → {self.season}")

    def collect_taxes(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.wealth -= 1
        self.season_log.append(f"t={self.time:.1f}: Taxes collected!")

    def step(self):
        # Normal step — agents earn money
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.wealth += self.random.randint(0, 2)

model = SeasonalModel(10)
model.run_for(20)

print("Timeline:")
for entry in model.season_log:
    print(f"  {entry}")
print(f"\nFinal season: {model.season}")
print(f"Average wealth: {model.agents.agg('wealth', np.mean):.1f}")
```

```
Timeline:
  t=3.0: Season → summer
  t=5.0: Taxes collected!
  t=6.0: Season → autumn
  t=9.0: Season → winter
  t=10.0: Taxes collected!
  t=12.0: Season → spring
  t=15.0: Taxes collected!
  t=15.0: Season → summer
  t=18.0: Season → autumn
  t=20.0: Taxes collected!

Final season: autumn
Average wealth: 26.2
```

### Controlling when recurring events start

By default, a recurring event first fires at `current_time + interval`. You can
override this with the `start` parameter:

```
class StartDemo(mesa.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Fires at t=5, t=10, t=15, ... (default start)
        self.schedule_recurring(
            self.default_start_event,
            Schedule(interval=5.0),
        )

        # Fires at t=0, t=5, t=10, ... (start immediately)
        self.schedule_recurring(
            self.start_at_zero_event,
            Schedule(interval=5.0, start=0.0),
        )

        # Fires at t=2, t=7, t=12, ... (custom start)
        self.schedule_recurring(
            self.start_at_two_event,
            Schedule(interval=5.0, start=2.0),
        )

    def default_start_event(self):
        print(f"  Default start: t={self.time:.1f}")

    def start_at_zero_event(self):
        print(f"  Start at 0:    t={self.time:.1f}")

    def start_at_two_event(self):
        print(f"  Start at 2:    t={self.time:.1f}")

    def step(self):
        pass

model = StartDemo()
print("Events firing during first 12 time units:")
model.run_for(12)
```

```
Events firing during first 12 time units:
  Start at 0:    t=0.0
  Start at 2:    t=2.0
  Default start: t=5.0
  Start at 0:    t=5.0
  Start at 2:    t=7.0
  Default start: t=10.0
  Start at 0:    t=10.0
  Start at 2:    t=12.0
```

### Stopping recurring events

`schedule_recurring` returns an `EventGenerator` that you can stop at any time:

```
class StopDemo(mesa.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.counter = 0

        # Start a recurring event
        self.ticker = self.schedule_recurring(
            self.tick,
            Schedule(interval=1.0),
        )

    def tick(self):
        self.counter += 1
        print(f"  Tick #{self.counter} at t={self.time:.1f}")

    def step(self):
        # Stop the ticker after 5 ticks
        if self.counter >= 5 and self.ticker.is_active:
            self.ticker.stop()
            print(f"  Ticker stopped at t={self.time:.1f}")

model = StopDemo()
model.run_for(10)
print(f"\nTotal ticks: {model.counter}")
```

```
  Tick #1 at t=1.0
  Tick #2 at t=2.0
  Tick #3 at t=3.0
  Tick #4 at t=4.0
  Tick #5 at t=5.0
  Ticker stopped at t=6.0

Total ticks: 5
```

### Using `end` and `count` for automatic limits

Instead of manually stopping a generator, you can set limits in the `Schedule` itself:

```
# Stop after time 50.0
Schedule(interval=5.0, end=50.0)
# Execute at most 10 times
Schedule(interval=5.0, count=10)
# Both: stop after 10 executions OR after time 50.0, whichever comes first
Schedule(interval=5.0, count=10, end=50.0)
```

### Dynamic intervals

The `interval` parameter can be a callable that returns the next interval dynamically.
The callable receives the model as its argument. This is useful for modeling processes
where the frequency changes over time:

```
class AcceleratingModel(mesa.Model):
    """A model where events happen faster and faster."""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.event_times = []

        # Interval starts at 4.0 and shrinks each time
        self.schedule_recurring(
            self.record_event,
            Schedule(
                interval=lambda m: max(1.0, 4.0 - m.time * 0.3),
                count=8,
            ),
        )

    def record_event(self):
        self.event_times.append(self.time)

    def step(self):
        pass

model = AcceleratingModel()
model.run_for(25)

print("Event times (accelerating intervals):")
for i, t in enumerate(model.event_times):
    if i > 0:
        gap = t - model.event_times[i - 1]
        print(f"  t={t:.1f} (gap: {gap:.1f})")
    else:
        print(f"  t={t:.1f}")
```

```
Event times (accelerating intervals):
  t=4.0
  t=6.8 (gap: 2.8)
  t=8.8 (gap: 2.0)
  t=10.1 (gap: 1.4)
  t=11.1 (gap: 1.0)
  t=12.1 (gap: 1.0)
  t=13.1 (gap: 1.0)
  t=14.1 (gap: 1.0)
```

## Event Priority

When multiple events are scheduled for the same time, **priority** determines execution
order. Mesa provides three priority levels:

- `Priority.HIGH` (1) — Executes first
- `Priority.DEFAULT` (5) — Normal priority
- `Priority.LOW` (10) — Executes last
  Lower numeric values mean higher priority. Note that the default model `step()` is
  scheduled at `Priority.HIGH`, so it runs before your custom events at the same time.

```
class PriorityDemo(mesa.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Schedule three events at the same time with different priorities
        self.schedule_event(
            self.low_priority_event,
            at=2.0,
            priority=Priority.LOW,
        )
        self.schedule_event(
            self.high_priority_event,
            at=2.0,
            priority=Priority.HIGH,
        )
        self.schedule_event(
            self.default_priority_event,
            at=2.0,
            priority=Priority.DEFAULT,
        )

    def low_priority_event(self):
        print(f"  LOW priority event at t={self.time:.1f}")

    def high_priority_event(self):
        print(f"  HIGH priority event at t={self.time:.1f}")

    def default_priority_event(self):
        print(f"  DEFAULT priority event at t={self.time:.1f}")

    def step(self):
        if self.time == 2.0:
            print(f"  Model step (HIGH priority) at t={self.time:.1f}")

model = PriorityDemo()
print("Events at t=2.0 in execution order:")
model.run_for(3)
```

```
Events at t=2.0 in execution order:
  HIGH priority event at t=2.0
  Model step (HIGH priority) at t=2.0
  DEFAULT priority event at t=2.0
  LOW priority event at t=2.0
```

Priority is useful when the order of operations matters. For example, you might want
data collection (HIGH) to happen before agent actions (DEFAULT), or environmental
updates (LOW) to happen after everything else.

## Putting It All Together: A Complete Example

Let’s build a more complete model that combines step-based agent activation with
discrete events. This is a simple economy where:

- Agents exchange money every step (standard activation)
- A central bank adjusts interest rates every 10 time units (recurring event)
- A one-time economic stimulus happens at t=25 (one-off event)
- The simulation runs until t=50

```
class Citizen(mesa.Agent):
    def __init__(self, model):
        super().__init__(model)
        self.wealth = 10

This model demonstrates the core pattern of Mesa 3.5: the `step()` method handles
regular per-step agent activation, while `schedule_event` and `schedule_recurring`
handle things that happen at specific times or on different schedules. The event system
manages all timing automatically — you just specify *what* should happen and *when*.

## When to Use Events vs Steps

| Use case | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Agents act every time unit | `step()` with `agents.shuffle_do()` |
| Something happens once at a known time | `schedule_event(fn, at=...)` |
| Something happens repeatedly on a schedule | `schedule_recurring(fn, Schedule(...))` |
| Something happens after a delay from now | `schedule_event(fn, after=...)` |
| Different processes run at different frequencies | Combine step + recurring events |
| Pure discrete-event simulation (no regular steps) | Use only `schedule_event` / `schedule_recurring` |
| The step mechanism itself is implemented as a recurring event under the hood (with |  |
| `Priority.HIGH`, interval 1.0, starting at t=1.0). This means steps and custom events |  |
| coexist naturally in the same time-ordered event queue. |  |

## Summary

**Running models:**

- `model.run_for(n)` — Advance time by `n` units
- `model.run_until(t)` — Advance time to absolute time `t`
  **One-off events:**
- `model.schedule_event(fn, at=t)` — Fire at absolute time `t`
- `model.schedule_event(fn, after=d)` — Fire `d` time units from now
- `event.cancel()` — Cancel before it fires
  **Recurring events:**
- `model.schedule_recurring(fn, Schedule(interval=...))` — Repeat on a schedule
- `Schedule(interval, start, end, count)` — Control timing, limits
- `generator.stop()` — Stop a recurring event
- `generator.is_active` — Check if still running
  **Priority:** `Priority.HIGH` → `Priority.DEFAULT` → `Priority.LOW`
  **Time tracking:** `model.steps` (integer count) and `model.time` (float)
